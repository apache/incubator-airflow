Issue reporting and resolution process
--------------------------------------

The Apache Airflow project uses a set of labels for tracking and triaging issues, as

fixes make it into an Airflow release. This is documented as part of
the `Issue reporting and resolution process <ISSUE_TRIAGE_PROCESS.rst>`_,
